    <h1>Reasons Why I, As A Local SEO Consultant, Will Not Take You On As A Client</h1>

    <p>
      This is not a sales page. It is a filter.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>I will not work with you if you expect SEO to be instant.</h2>
    <p>Search Engine Optimisation compounds over time. Urgency belongs elsewhere.</p>

    <h2>I will not work with you if you need guarantees before action.</h2>
    <p>SEO operates under uncertainty. Decisions precede proof.</p>

    <h2>I will not work with you if implementation is optional.</h2>
    <p>Advice that is not followed changes nothing.</p>

    <h2>I will not work with you if you can't respect time boundaries.</h2>
    <p>My time is valuable too. </p>

      If none of the above caused you to argue internally, explain yourself, or mentally add caveats, you may be a fit.

That does not mean we should work together, but we can talk - email:<br>

      Include:

(Your website, What you believe is actually wrong, How patient you are with SEO timeframes)

Anything else suggests this page did its job.
